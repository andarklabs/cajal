# Guiding python file for mat_math.cpp files (same tests, same functions, timed)
# 
# The goal of this python file, and it's corresponding c++ files, is to provide 
# fast and memory efficent utility files that will be used for the tensor mathmatics 
# throughout the rest of the program

import time
# import numpy # we wish to essentially make numpy obsolete (this is the whole purpose of this part of the project)
