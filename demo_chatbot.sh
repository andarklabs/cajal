echo "🧠 TECHNICAL SPECS:"
echo "   • Model: Decoder-only Transformer (GPT-style)"
echo "   • Architecture: 6 layers, 8 heads, 512 embedding dim"
echo "   • Performance: 0.7-15ms per inference (model size dependent)"
echo "   • Safety: Comprehensive vulnerability protection"
echo "   • Memory: Half-precision optimized, 11-65MB usage"
echo ""
echo "🎮 CHATBOT FEATURES:"
echo "   • Autoregressive text generation"
echo "   • Conversation context management"
echo "   • Multiple sampling strategies"
echo "   • Real-time response timing"
